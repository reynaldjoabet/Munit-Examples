Test coverage is, without a doubt, one of the best ways to measure if we have enough tests and to detect if there are any untested areas in the application.


Code coverage is a very good metric for analyzing the coverage of the tests in the codebase. It helps to evaluate the effectiveness of the testing process. Moreover, it highlights the areas of code that arenâ€™t covered with tests.

There are two main types of code coverage. Firstly, statement coverage checks the percentage of lines of code covered using the tests. Secondly, branch coverage calculates the test coverage for the different conditions within the codebase. By combining these two types, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the total test coverage.


Some of the advantages of using scoverage are:

Support for statement and branch coverage
Integration with different build tools such as sbt, Maven, Gradle, and so on
HTML and XML-based coverage reports
Good customizable options
Works with all Scala testing libraries such as ScalaTest, uTest, MUnit, and so on, as it relies on bytecode instrumentation for code coverage checks.
